  Michael K Schumacher's shell scripts

These are some BASH scripts I tend to use
on Linux, primarily Arch Linux.

I'll probably also add some Python scripts
that take use input to run OS scripts,
for more simplicity and user functionality

Feel free to use them and modify them to
suit your own needs, etc.

     Released as free and open-source
